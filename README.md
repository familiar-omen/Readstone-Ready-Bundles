Redstone Ready Bundles is a minecraft mod adding basic redstone interaction to the bundle.

When a bundle is placed in a pot (by hand, hopper or alternatives) it can be inserted into by hoppers or players (current implementation is hopper specific)
When a comparater reads a pot with a bundle in it, it gets a signal 1 - 15 depending on how full the bundle is
When a dispenser attempts to dispense a bundle with items in it, it instead pushes out items like a player does with right click
